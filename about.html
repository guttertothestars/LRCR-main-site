            <strong>Little Rome is, first and foremost, a family endeavor</strong>
            that was born when my wife and I lost childcare during COVID. Freelancing
            gave me the freedom to have a flexible schedule and give my daughter
            the attention she deserves. ßThat's what I get out of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have spent nearly a decade in leadership roles at two, well-known shops
            in Washington, DC. However, my love for bicycles started in the unlikeliest
            of cities: my hometown, the car-centric Houston. The spark for bicycle repair
            began when I got a flat four miles from home (in the Texas July heat!).
            When I moved to DC, I joined the team at The Bike Rack in Logan Circle as
            the Service Manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            At The Bike Rack, major accomplishments included managing up to twelve
            fellow mechanics, supporting the opening of a second location, redesigning
            the interior layout to reflect industry trends towards repair-focused shops,
            and maximizing revenue while developing close relationships with loyal
            customers. Many of these individuals made Little Rome possible. Just before
            COVID, I was the Service Manager at Conte's Bike Shop, a full-service, multi-city
            bike retailer that took over The Bike Rack’s Logan Circle location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the years, I have seen it all, from pre-war, three speeds to
            World-Tour level race machines — sometimes one right after the other.
            <strong>I believe that bicycles transform people’s lives. My interests are reliable
              wheel builds, frame up custom builds, and maintenance of high-mileage
              bicycles for people who love to ride.</strong> I am a member of the Professional
            Bicycle Mechanics Association and Shimano S-TEC certified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the team includes my toddler who knows that Papa “loves fixing things,”
            my cats who may occasionally sniff your wheels, and my wife who pitches
            in as a wordsmith. <strong>Little Rome allows me to do the work that made me
              fall in love with being a mechanic: uninterrupted, unhurried, and tailored to
              your needs.</strong> And the name is a nod to Brookland, the DC neighborhood
            where we live.
          </p>
          <p>
            To sum up, I get to be your bicycle’s advocate. That's what you get out of it.

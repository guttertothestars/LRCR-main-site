    <h1 class="h1-service-page">Bicyle Repair Services</h1>
    <p class="p-service-page">Little Rome is dedicated to creating the best possible repair experience in DC. Little Rome is service - it is all we do. The rates are competitive and the work is guaranteed. Services are done by appointment and pickup
      and dropoff may be available.</p>

    <p class="p-service-page">Every repair starts with a thoughtful dialogue and a comprehensive assessment of your bike's needs. Transparency and honesty are core tenets. The only thing we have to sell is your bike in its best form. We aim to be
      your bike's best advocate.</p>

    <h2 class="h2-service-page">Rough Pricing Guidelines</h2>

    <p class="p-service-page">Not every bike repair falls into a neat category and often a repair estimate will be done with an a la carte collection of needs.</p>

    <p class="p-service-page">If a bike does need a tune up there are three broad packages that are $100, $200, and $300. The nuts and bolts (and cables and chains) of each package can be delved into if your bike needs one. Most heavily-ridden bikes
      could use the middle package annually-ish. If you do get a tuneup you'll get a copy of a very detailed checklist of checks and repairs, as well as notes about your job along with guidance for the future. </p>

    <p class="p-service-page">For repairs that don't fall into a package rates are competitive for the DC market - about what you would expect from any shop you walked into. </p>

    <h2 class="h2-service-page"> Favorite Things</h2>

    <p class="p-service-page">If we had our druthers all we'd do is dream-machines for dreamier people. No other jobs allow for as much creativity, collaboration, and nuance. To that end custom builds are $350, and for $500 we'll build a wheelset to
      complete your vision
      <p />
